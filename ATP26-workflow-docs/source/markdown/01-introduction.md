## Philosophy of the GNU Project

*Free software* means that the software\'s users have freedom. (The
issue is not about price.) We developed the GNU operating system so that
users can have freedom in their computing.

Specifically, free software means users have the [four essential
freedoms](/philosophy/free-sw.html): (0) to run the program, (1) to
study and change the program in source code form, (2) to redistribute
exact copies, and (3) to distribute modified versions.

Software differs from material objects---such as chairs, sandwiches, and
gasoline---in that it can be copied and changed much more easily. These
facilities are why software is useful; we believe a program\'s users
should be free to take advantage of them, not solely its developer.
